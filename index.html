      <p class="tissues">There are four types of tissue, epithelial, connective, muscular, and nerve. these tissues are made up of cells and form organs.</p>
      <h3 class="tissues">Epithelial</h3>
      <p class="tissues">Epithelial tissue lines cavties and hollow organs, as well as covering all body surfaces. According to the <a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/cells_tissues_membranes/tissues/epithelial.html" class="tissues">National Cancer Institute</a>, "They perform a variety of functions that include protection, secretion, absorption, excretion, filtration, diffusion, and sensory reception." There are seven types of epithelial tissue, transational, which changes shape, and six others. The other six types are divided into three main groups, cuboidal, which is made up of cubi-shaped cells, spuamous, which is made of very flat cells, and columnar, which is mad of high cells with a small length and width. If there's only one layer of a type of cell, it's reffered to as simple (e.g. simple cuboidal), and if ther are multiple layers, it's stratified (e.g. stratified squamous). These differnt arrangments of different cells serve different functions, for example, while simple cuboidal tissue can be found in kidney tubules, simple columnar tissue lines the stomach and intestines.</p>

      <h3 class="tissues">Connective</h3>
      <p class="tissues">Connective tissues serve many functions such as binding together structures in the body, storing fat, and protecting against disease. The cells in connective tissue are very loosely packed, in stark contrast with epithelial tissue. According to the <a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/cells_tissues_membranes/tissues/connective.html" class="tissues">National Cancer Institute</a>, "Connective tissue cells are able to reproduce but not as rapidly as epithelial cells. Most connective tissues have a good blood supply but some do not."</p>
