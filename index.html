      <h2 id="1"class="one">Cells in Living Things</h2>
      <p class="one"></p>
      <h2 id="2" class="two">Components of Cells</h2>
      <p class="two">There are three parts of a cell, the membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The membrane is the outer wall of the cell, within the membrane is the cytoplasm, which has the nucleus as well as many organelles floating around inside it. Organelles are similar to organs, preforming various functions of the cell, such as ribosomes, which form proteins from amino acids, or lysosomes, which contain enzymes to break down parts of the cell that are no longer needed.</p>
      <h3 class="two">Cell Membrane</h3>
      <p class="two">The cell membrane has proteins to give it structure, these proteins can also create channels to transfer materials or inform other cells of what type of cell it is.According to the <a class="two" href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/cells_tissues_membranes/cells/structure.html">National Cancer Institute</a>, "All materials within a cell must have access to the cell membrane (the cell's boundary) for the needed exchange." It seperates the inside of the cell from the outside world and controls the flow of materials both in and out of the cell.</p>
      <h3 class="two">Cytoplasm</h3>
      <p class="two">The cytoplasm is a gel-like substance within the cell. All organelles and the nucleus float in the cytoplasm. It acts as a medium for chemical reactions and materials can move through it by a rocess known as diffusion, where molecules in higher density areas are pushed towards areas with lower density.</p>
      <h3 class="two">Nucleus</h3>
      <p class="two">The nucleus is essentially the brain of the cell. It contains the DNA and RNA which act as the code of the cell, telling it what proteins to make, how to make them, what to do with them, and many more important functions.</p>
      <h3 class="two">Organelles</h3>
      <p class="two">There are many organelles within a cell, and each one serves a different and inportant function. The reason for the name <em>organelle</em> is that organelles act as organs, each one preforming a diferent and important function within the cell, as I said earlier. One such organelle is ribosomes, which create proteins from amino acids according to the DNA's instructions. Another organelle is lysosomes, which release enzymes to recycle other parts of the cell when necessary.</p>
      <h2 id="tissues" class="tissues">Tissues</h2>
      <p class="tissues">There are four types of tissue, epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous. These tissues are made up of cells and form organs.</p>
      <h3 class="tissues">Epithelial</h3>
      <p class="tissues">Epithelial tissue lines cavties and hollow organs, as well as covering all body surfaces. According to the <a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/cells_tissues_membranes/tissues/epithelial.html" class="tissues">National Cancer Institute</a>, "They perform a variety of functions that include protection, secretion, absorption, excretion, filtration, diffusion, and sensory reception." There are seven types of epithelial tissue, transational, which changes shape, and six others. The other six types are divided into three main groups, cuboidal, which is made up of cubi-shaped cells, spuamous, which is made of very flat cells, and columnar, which is mad of high cells with a small length and width. If there's only one layer of a type of cell, it's reffered to as simple (e.g. simple cuboidal), and if ther are multiple layers, it's stratified (e.g. stratified squamous). These differnt arrangments of different cells serve different functions, for example, while simple cuboidal tissue can be found in kidney tubules, simple columnar tissue lines the stomach and intestines.</p>

      <h3 class="tissues">Connective</h3>
      <p class="tissues">Connective tissues serve many functions such as binding together structures in the body, storing fat, and protecting against disease. The cells in connective tissue are very loosely packed, in stark contrast with epithelial tissue. According to the <a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/cells_tissues_membranes/tissues/connective.html" class="tissues">National Cancer Institute</a>, "Connective tissue cells are able to reproduce but not as rapidly as epithelial cells. Most connective tissues have a good blood supply but some do not."</p>
      <h3 class="tissues">Muscular</h3>
      <p class="tissues">Muscle tissue is made up of cells that have the ability to contract and expand, which is how your muscles move.According to the <a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/cells_tissues_membranes/tissues/muscle.html">National Cancer Institute</a>, "The tissue is highly cellular and is well supplied with blood vessels. The cells are long and slender so they are sometimes called muscle fibers...".There are three different types of muscle tissue. These are skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle. Skeletal muscle is the only type of muscle you have voluntary control of, and is found near your bones. Smooth mucle tissue is normally found in internal organs. Finally, cardiac muscle is found exclusively in the heart.</p>
      <h3 class="tissues">Nervous</h3>
      <p class="tissues">Nervous tissue relays information to the brain and relays commands from the brain to muscles, causing them to contract. According to the <a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/cells_tissues_membranes/tissues/nervous.html">National Cancer Institute</a>, "To do all these things, cells in nervous tissue need to be able to communicate with each other by way of electrical nerve impulses."</p>
      <h2 id="4" class="four">Natural Selection in Plants and Animals</h2>
      <p>In animal populations, certain traits are more beneficial to survival than others, and therefore animals with the trait less condusive to survival die off and those with better traits thrive. Due to this, as time progresses, traits more dominant to survival become more and more predominant in a given region. In most animals there are two types of traits, genetic and acquired. A genetic trait is inherited from a creatures parents, such as eye-color, or immunity to a certain disease. Acquired traits are learned during life and are not passed down to children, this could be something such as a human learning how to do algebra, or create a webpage. Genetic traits are determined by which genes an animal or plant receives from its parents (assuming it has parents). Animals inherit two genes (in most cases), one from each parent. This means that animals commonly have two genes reprsenting different qualities, however, some genes are recessive to other genes and so while a gene may lie dormant within an animal, it can still be passed on to its children. An animals genotype is the information in its genes, such as one dominant gene and one reccesive gene for hair color, whereas its phenotype is the animals outward appearence, so two animals that have the same outward trait could have the same phenotype but have different genotypes and therefore possibly different offspring. A common example of this, while vastly oversimplified, is that the brown eye gene is dominant over the blue eye gene, and so if someone with a parent with only the brown eye gene and a blue-eyed parent married another person with the same genes passed down to them, they would both have a genotype of brown eye and blue eye, meaning that their child could have blue eyes even though neither of them did.</p>
