        <li>Water evaporates from bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, & oceans</li>
        <li>Water vapor condenses into clouds</li>
        <li>Precipitation occurs. Precipitation is rain, snow, hail, & sleet that falls from clouds. This precipitation can land in one of three general places: a body of water (back to step 1), on the ground, or on a mountain, where if it isn't already snow, it will become snow or ice.</li>
      <li>If the precipitated water became runoff (landed on the ground) it will either go into a body of water (back to step 1) or it will become groundwater through infiltration. However, if the precipitation became snow or ice, it will eventually melt and become runoff itself.</li>
        <li>One of two things will happen to groundwater: It will either A, seep into a body of water through groundwater discharge (back to step 1), or B, be sucked into a plant through it's root system.</li>
        <li>Finally, water that has been sucked up by plants will evaporate through transpiration (back to step 2). Transpiration occurs due to pores called "stomatoes" in a plant's leaves letting water evaporate out of the plant, similar to sweating in humans.</li>

    <h3 class="water" id="water2">How the Water Cycle Works</h3>
        <p class="water">The various processes involved in the water cycle are mainly governed by some combination of gravity and sunlight, the following list will list each process in the water cycle along side a descriptpion of how that process is mainly governed by the two aforementioned occurances (sunlight & gravity)</p>
        <ul class="water">
            <li>Evaporation-Evaporation is caused by <strong>sunlight</strong> heating up water enough that some of it evaporates</li>
            <li>Condensation-Condensation is infact one of the only aspects of the water cycle that, as far as I'm aware, is not governed by sunlight or gravity</li>
            <li>Precipitation-Precipitation is caused by <strong>gravity</strong> pulling particulates of rain down from the clouds when the water in the drop has condensed around a mote of dust or insect</li>
            <li>Infiltration-Infiltration is caused by <strong>gravity</strong> pulling runoff, puddles, etc. into the ground when it can, causing that water to become groundwater</li>
                <li>Runoff-Runoff is caused by <strong>gravity</strong> pulling water on the ground down various slopes until it reaches a body of water</li>
            <li>Melting-Melting is caused by <strong>sunlight</strong> heating up snow or ice to the point where it melts into a liquid</li>
            <li>Transpiration-Transpiration is essentially plants sweating, the sweat is then evaporated (and in fact can even be caused by) <strong>sunlight</strong></li>

      <h3 class="water" id="water4">Interconnected Ocean Currents</h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Ocean_circulation_conveyor_belt.jpg"width="595" class="water">
    <p class="water">As illustrated in the above picture, there is a cycle of interconnected ocean currents commonly reffered to as "The Great Ocean Conveyer Belt". This belt is caused by thermohaline (thermo=temperature, haline=salinity) circulation. Thermohaline circulation occurs deep within the ocean and allows it to act as a sort of conveyer belt which absorbs, stores, & redistributes vast amounts of the Sun's heat around the world, without it, places at the same lattitude on the globe would have temperatures that were generally similar. However, at the moment there can be vast differences between the temperatures of places at similar lattitudes. For example, there is almost a 20 degree gap between the average annual temperatures of Norway and Manitoba, Canada. The belt transfers water from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean in a warm, shallow current and vice-versa in a deep, cold current that is South of the warmer one. Starting in the central Pacific the belt travels past the North coast of Australia and around the tip of Africa. As it goes up into the Atlantic it becomes the Gulf Stream and when it passes Western Europe the warm water evaporates, simultaneously cooling itself off and warming the atmosphere at that point, this is responsible for Western Europe's relatively warm climate. When the water cools off it increases in salinty and attains a higher density, this causes it to sink thousands of feet beneath the surface, slowly travelling South in the abyss of the depths, only surfacing after up to 1,000 years.</p>

        <h4 class="weather">Coriolis Effect</h4>
        <img src="https://pixfeeds.com/images/13/379858/1280-379858-coriolis-effect.jpg" width="600" class="weather">
        <p class="weather">The arrows in the above picture show the path an object would take if you were standing at the equator and threw it towards one of the poles, assuming you throw in an exactly straight line and the object travels far enough you will note that instead of traveling in a straight line it curves to the right in the north hemisphere and left in the south. This is because different parts of the Earth travel at different speeds. This occurs because no matter where you stand that point will have traveled in a circle around Earth's axis in 24 hours, the problem is that at certain points that circle is a <em>lot</em>larger than others. For example, a point on the equator has to travel around the circumfrence of the Earth (~25,000 miles) in 24 hours making that point travel at a speed of ~1,040 mph, while a point a foot away from the north pole only has to travel ~6 feet in the same amount of time making it move at only ~0.00005 mph. Of course, when an object is thrown perpendicular to the throwers direction of movement, the object retains some momentum in the direction the thrower is moving and therefore curves in that direction. This is how the coriolis effect works as it means that when an object moves towards a part of the planet it appears to curve in the direction the planet spins in, and when thrown towards an area that spins slower it will appear to curve the opposite direction.</p>

        <img src="http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/uploads/news/GreenhouseEffect.jpg" width="600" class="cc">
        <p class="cc">As you can see in the above image, heat from the sun bounces off the Earth and back into the atmosphere, some of that heat bounces back, and some goes straight through. This is caused by gases called greenhouse gases (GHG) which are named due to the fact that they act somewhat like the walls of a greenhouse in that they bounce back some of the heat that hits them. As you may have noticed in the bottom-left corner of the image above, without the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the Earth would become <em>very</em> cold. However, humans are currently pumping immense amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, this could eventually result in an increase of several degrees farenheit, you may be thinking that a few degrees won't make much of a difference, but the latest ice age was a meager <strong>12</strong> degrees colder. Infact, an increase of just <strong>one</strong> degree would raise the sea level enough to displace tens of thousands of people living on islands or the coast. Due to rising sea levels caused by global warming, by 2045, 64,000 homes in Florida will be at risk of flooding evry other <strong>week</strong>, and that number could jump to a <strong>million</strong> by 2100, according to <a href="climaterealityproject.org">this</a> webpage. Agriculture also has an effect on climate change, notonly is at a significant user of land and fossil fuels, but it also directly contributes to greenhouse gas emmissions through pratices such as rice production and the raising of livestock, as is detailed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080625012113/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf">here</a>. Also, accordig to the IPCC, agriculture is one of the top three contributors to climate change (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070501031449/http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/wg1-report.html">Source</a>). The concrete industry is responsible for over 5% of man-made CO2 emmissions, a relatively high number (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070714085318/http://www.wbcsd.org/DocRoot/1IBetslPgkEie83rTa0J/cement-action-plan.pdf">Source</a>). The Co2 pproduced in the creation of standard concrete is 410 kg/cubic meter according to <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ehbL6Z5-8AwC">this</a></p>
        <h3 id="ghg" class="cc">Greenhouse Gases</h3>
        <p class="cc">Two characteristics of gases determine their greenhouse effect, one of them is GWP (Global Warming Potential) and their atmospheric lifetime. The GWP is a measure of the radiative effect of each unit of gas over a specified period of time. This is expressed relatively to the most common greenhouse gas, CO2. An amount of gas with a high GWP wil warm the Earth more than the same amount of CO2 over a given amount of time. The atmospheric lifetime determines how long a gas will remain in the atmosphere before it is disposed of by natural processes (such as chemical reactions). A gas with a long atmospheric lifetime can exert more influence on global warming tha one with a shorter lifetime (assuming they have equivalent GWP's). The table below contains both of these values for the various greenhouse gases according to the Fourth IPCC Assesment Report (AR4), information from which, I found <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/main-greenhouse-gases/">here</a>.</p>
